# lybrate_clone
welcome to this repo,
as part of unit2 construct week our team(sagar, deepak, ankur and me) was asigned a task to clone the website lybrate(https://www.lybrate.com/?lpt=NAV), we have worked 4 days straight day and night and given our best to clone in the best possible way we can.

here the bookApointment, consultOnline, goodCart, login/signup, healthfeed and doctors sections are the part we have majorly focused to clone(create)

the user flow that we tried to maintain is,
  home -> healthfeed -> bookApointment -> login/signup -> askQuestion -> forDoctors -> login?signup -> answerQuestion & view submitted responses -> healthfed(to view updated)
also 
  home -> consultOnline -> consultNow
  home -> goodcart ->home
  

we really enjoyed this whole part of clonning and have given our best efforts to bring the same thing as original.
